        1.	Meky Lin
        2.	I am a double major at Whitman with a business analysis major and an information management major at the iSchool. I chose these two majors as I’m interested in the organization and analysis of data in a broader spectrum. 
        3.	Skills:
        a.	Organized
        b.	Adaptable
        c.	Python
        d.	RStudio
        4.	I like to start a lot of hobbies, I have briefly tapped into learning how to skate, do nails, bake, and read. Some interests that have stuck around were true crime podcasts, skin care, and movies. 
        5.	I’m still trying to figure out exactly what I want to do in the future, I am just going with the flow as of right now.
